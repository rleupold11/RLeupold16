<p><br>
  Before you use Microsoft Access to actually build the tables, forms, and other 
  objects that will make up your database, it is important to <i>take time to 
  design your database</i>. Whether you are using a Microsoft Access database 
  or a Microsoft Access project, good database design is the keystone to creating 
  a database that does what you want it to do effectively, accurately, and efficiently. 
</p>
<p>Steps in designing a database:<br>
  1. Determine the purpose of your database<br>
  2. Determine the tables you need in the database<br>
  3. Determine the fields you need in the tables<br>
  4. Identify fields with unique values in each record<br>
  5. Determine the relationships between tables<br>
  6. Refine your design<br>
  7. Enter data and create other database objects<br>
  8. Use Microsoft Access analysis tools </p>
<p><br>
  1 Determine the purpose of your database<br>
  The first step in designing a database is to determine its purpose and how it's 
  to be used. You need to know what information you want from the database. From 
  that, you can determine what subjects you need to store facts about (the tables) 
  and what facts you need to store about each subject (the fields in the tables).</p>
<p>Talk to people who will use the database. Brainstorm about the questions you 
  and they would like the database to answer. Sketch out the reports you'd like 
  it to produce. Gather the forms you currently use to record your data. Examine 
  well-designed databases similar to the one you are designing.</p>
<p>2 Determine the tables you need<br>
  Determining the tables can be the trickiest step in the database design process. 
  That's because the results you want from your database &#151; the reports you 
  want to print, the forms you want to use, the questions you want answered &#151; 
  don't necessarily provide clues about the structure of the tables that produce 
  them.</p>
<p>You don't need to design your tables using Microsoft Access. In fact, it may 
  be better to sketch out and rework your design on paper first. When you design 
  your tables, divide up pieces of information by keeping these fundamental design 
  principles in mind: </p>
<p>A table should not contain duplicate information, and information should not 
  be duplicated between tables. In this respect, a table in a relational database 
  differs from a table in a flat-file application such as a spreadsheet. <br>
  When each piece of information is stored in only one table, you update it in 
  one place. This is more efficient, and it also eliminates the possibility of 
  duplicate entries that contain different information. For example, you would 
  want to store each customer address and phone number only once, in one table. 
</p>
<p>Each table should contain information about one subject. <br>
  When each table contains facts about only one subject, you can maintain information 
  about each subject independently from other subjects. For example, you would 
  store customer addresses in a different table from the customers' orders, so 
  that you could delete one order and still maintain the customer information. 
</p>
<p>3 Determine the fields you need<br>
  Each table contains information about the same subject, and each field in a 
  table contains individual facts about the table's subject. For example, a customer 
  table may include company name, address, city, state, and phone number fields. 
  When sketching out the fields for each table, keep these tips in mind: </p>
<p>Relate each field directly to the subject of the table.<br>
  Don't include derived or calculated data (data that is the result of an expression).<br>
  Include all the information you need.<br>
  Store information in its smallest logical parts (for example, First Name and 
  Last Name, rather than Name). <br>
  Compare field data types in an Access database with those in an Access project.</p>
<p>4 Identify the field or fields with unique values in each record<br>
  In order for Microsoft Access to connect information stored in separate tables 
  &#151; for example, to connect a customer with all the customer's orders &#151; 
  each table in your database must include a field or set of fields that uniquely 
  identifies each individual record in the table. Such a field or set of fields 
  is called a primary key.</p>
<p>5 Determine the relationships between tables<br>
  Now that you've divided your information into tables and identified primary 
  key fields, you need a way to tell Microsoft Access how to bring related information 
  back together again in meaningful ways. To do this, you define relationships 
  between tables in a Microsoft Access database.</p>
<p>You may find it useful to view the relationships in an existing well-designed 
  database. For example, open the Northwind sample database and click Relationships 
  on the Tools menu to see the relationships between its tables. </p>
<p>6 Refine your design<br>
  After you have designed the tables, fields, and relationships you need, it's 
  time to study the design and detect any flaws that might remain. It is easier 
  to change your database design now than it will be after you have filled the 
  tables with data.</p>
<p>Use Microsoft Access to create your tables, specify relationships between the 
  tables, and enter enough sample data in your tables so you can test your design. 
  To test the relationships in your database, see if you can create queries to 
  get the answers you want. Create rough drafts of your forms and reports and 
  see if they show the data you expect. Look for unnecessary duplications of data 
  and eliminate them. If you find problems, refine the design.</p>
<p>7 Enter data and create other database objects<br>
  When you are satisfied that the table structures meet the design principles 
  described here, then it's time to go ahead and add all your existing data to 
  the tables. You can then create any queries, forms, reports, data access pages, 
  macros, and modules that you may want.</p>
<p>8 Use Microsoft Access analysis tools<br>
  Microsoft Access includes two tools that can help you to refine the design of 
  your Microsoft Access database. The Table Analyzer Wizard can analyze the design 
  of one table at a time, can propose new table structures and relationships if 
  appropriate, and can divide a table into new related tables if that makes sense. 
</p>
<p>The Performance Analyzer can analyze your entire database and make recommendations 
  and suggestions for improving it. The wizard can also implement these recommendations 
  and suggestions. </p>
<p>For additional ideas on designing a Microsoft Access database, you may want 
  to look at the design of the Northwind sample database or of one of the databases 
  that you can create with the Database Wizard. </p>
